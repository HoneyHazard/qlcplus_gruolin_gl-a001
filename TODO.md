# TODO

- update description to talk about Grulon vs Olaalite; GL-002
- 5/6 channel modes
- scan pdf for GL-A002

# OL-A002

- verify colors
- verify animation every 8 values

# Further Plans

If further polished, this could be uplodaded/converted to become part of Open Fixture Library:

https://open-fixture-library.org/fixture-editor

Can this be included with QLC+ main codebase? These lasers are fun
