# TODO

- update description to talk about Grulon vs Olaalite; GL-002
- 6 channel modes for GL-001 and GL-002
- pdf copy for GL-A001
- scan pdf for GL-A002

# Further Plans

If further polished, this could be uplodaded/converted to become part of Open Fixture Library:

https://open-fixture-library.org/fixture-editor

Can this be included with QLC+ main codebase? These lasers are fun
