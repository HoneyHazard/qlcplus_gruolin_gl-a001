# Introduction

qlcplus fixture files for:

- Gruolin GL-A001 laser
- Olaalite OL-A001 laser, which appears to be near identical to Gruolin GL-A001
- Olaalite OL-A002 laser, which is idential or near-identical to Gruolin GL-A02
  - it may not even be possible to purchase Gruolin GL-A02 as such, as Olaalite OL-A002 arrives

Currently, only 34-channel (advanced/customizable) modes are available here.

5/6-channel, simplified modes should also be added.

## Lasers Info

### Gruolin GL-A001

The laser basically allows two (almost) independent images to be projected.

- 6CH Simple Line & Annimation Pattern at DMX address `E.001` (not implemented here yet)
- 34CH Proffessional Line & Animation Pattern at DMX address `A.001`

### Olaalite OL-A001

Either same people/company (suddenly?) selling under a different name or some kind of clone of Gruolin GL-A001.

There could some, and maybe even important differences within parameters, but overall this appears to be a clone of GL-A001

The DMX addresses and channels are a little different:

- 5CH Simple Line & Annimation Pattern at DMX address `J.001` (not implemented here yet)
- 34CH Proffessional Line & Animation Pattern at DMX address `D.001`

 I expect everything or almost everything to work with the fixture mapping for Gruolin GL-A001. If somebody wants to test drive this laser with my mapping for GL-A001 or dive into the user manual to pick out all differences in DMX values by all means! I am unable to do so at the moment.

### Gruolin GL-A02 / Olaalite OL-A002

I purchased this as a Gruolin product, which shows GL-A02 in product images on Amazon. However, the laser that arrived is clearly labeled as Olaalite OL-A002. Thus, you may not be able to purchase Gruolin GL-A02 as such.

This upgrade appears to:
- allow independent gallery and line/beam mode for the second pattern
- rated 30w instead of 20w
- likely rearranges how some parameters and effects work

DMX addresses:

- 6CH Simple Line & Annimation Pattern at DMX address `E.001` (not implemented here yet)
- 34CH Proffessional Line & Animation Pattern at DMX address `D.001`


#### Amazon Product Page

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCMM8BHJ/

Amazon product page presents the laser as Gruolin GL-A02, but the purchased laser arrives branded as Olaalite OL-A002
