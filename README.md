# qlcplus_gruolin_gl-a001

qlcplus fixture for Gruolin GL-A001 laser

Currently, only 34-channel (advanced) mode is implemented.

6-channel, simplified mode should also be added.

ðŸš§ *WORK IN PROGRESS* ðŸš§

## About the Laser

The laser basically allows two (almost) independent images to be projected.

# Further Plans

6CH simplified mode should implemented.

Then, if further polished, this could be uplodaded/converted to become part of Open Fixture Library:

https://open-fixture-library.org/fixture-editor

Or be included with QLC+ main codebase? The laser is a fun one.
